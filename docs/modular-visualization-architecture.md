# Modular Visualization Architecture

## Core Components

1. **Visualization Engine**: 
   - Handles 3D rendering, camera controls, and basic node/connection display
   - Remains consistent across all modes

2. **Data Layer**: 
   - Manages data fetching, caching, and updates
   - Implements a generic data model that can be adapted for different use cases

3. **Interaction Layer**: 
   - Manages user inputs (clicks, drags, key presses)
   - Dispatches events to active mode handlers

4. **Mode System**: 
   - Allows switching between different interpretation modes
   - Each mode can customize appearance, behavior, and interactions

5. **Plugin Architecture**: 
   - Enables easy addition of new modes without modifying core code
   - Defines interfaces for mode integration

## Mode Implementation

Each mode (e.g., AI Knowledge Base, Genealogy, Mind Map, File Browser) is implemented as a plugin that includes:

1. **Data Interpreter**: 
   - Translates generic data model to mode-specific representations

2. **Visual Customizer**: 
   - Defines mode-specific appearance for nodes and connections

3. **Interaction Handler**: 
   - Implements mode-specific responses to user interactions

4. **UI Components**: 
   - Provides mode-specific controls and information displays

## Example Mode Implementations

1. **AI Knowledge Base Mode**:
   - Nodes represent concepts, sized by importance
   - Connections show relationships, colored by type
   - Interaction: Query AI, edit knowledge

2. **Genealogy Mode**:
   - Nodes represent individuals
   - Connections show family relationships
   - Interaction: Add family members, view/edit personal info

3. **Mind Map Mode**:
   - Nodes represent ideas or topics
   - Connections show associations
   - Interaction: Quick idea entry, drag to create connections

4. **File Browser Mode**:
   - Nodes represent files and folders
   - Connections show directory structure
   - Interaction: Open files, create/delete/move items

## Implementation Steps

1. Refactor core visualization engine to be mode-agnostic
2. Implement plugin system and define plugin interfaces
3. Create a mode manager for switching between modes
4. Develop individual modes as plugins
5. Update UI to allow mode selection and mode-specific controls

This architecture allows for maintaining a generalist approach while enabling specialized features for different use cases.
